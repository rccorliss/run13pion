# run13pion
This is a distillation and continuation of the work that Pedro
Montuenga did in his thesis, with an attempt to simplify and document
the software.
To run this, you need to have run Pmmpc13 through ana train.
then:
mkdir yields
mkdir asyms
Run_rcc_gen_yield.C will then need to be edited to have your local dirs.
Run Run_rcc_gen_yield and you'll get out the uncorrected ALL by run.  Much
remains before this will be accurate.
